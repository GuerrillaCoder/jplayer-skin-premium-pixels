# jPlayer Skins

A collection of basic skins for [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org/), the jQuery HTML5 Audio / Video Library.

## Creating Skins

Add skins by creating a folder inside the ```skins/``` folder. Give this folder the name of the skin (e.g. "my-skin-name"). Inside that folder, include a CSS file with the same name (e.g. "my-skin-name.css").

## Changing Skins

To view a different skin in the Demo (index.html), find the skin wrapper element and change the ```data-skin-name``` attibute to the name of a skin in the ```skins/``` folder. 

```<div id="skin-wrapper" data-skin-name="my-skin-name">```
